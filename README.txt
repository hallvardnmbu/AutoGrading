AutoGrading
===========

Web application for automatic grading of programming assignments by using OpenAI API (ChatGPT). The
student's submissions are then highligted with comments based on the API's response.

Future
------
* Store feedback in a database (and link it to the specific student)
* Improve the UI
* Desktop application
* Automatic code testing (unit tests, flake8, etc.)
* Move away from ChatGPT to a cheaper/local solution
